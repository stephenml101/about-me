    <p>I was born and raised on the East Coast of the United States. I moved to Phoenix, Arizona 14 years ago and have been here ever since. I am married to my wife Ellie, and we are due to have a beautiful baby girl on July 9th. We also have our fur baby, Bella, and she brings us joy every day. My goals with coding are to provide for my family and to further help my growing real estate business. Since I am a realtor, my goal is to develop software that will compliment not only my business, but other's as well. </p>
